# Solidity-Inbox-Smart-Contract
Part 2 of the Udemy course: "Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide". 

In this course a project was created to compile, test and deploy a simple smart contract onto the Ethereum blockchain.

### Setup
``` npm install ```

### Run tests
``` npm run test ```

### Deploy
To deploy, make sure you have an ethereum account with a mnemonic and an Infura account. For this project we used the Rinkeby test network.
Once the two accounts have been created, replace lines 6 and 7 in the ``` deploy.js ``` file with your details and run ``` node deploy.js ```
